## Overview

The **Cold Email Generator** is an AI-powered system that automates the creation of highly personalized cold outreach emails. It combines **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** — to ground email content in relevant, factual context (e.g., company info, job postings, portfolio data) — with a CREWAI **multi-agent orchestration** pipeline, where specialized agents handle distinct stages of the email-generation process (research, retrieval, drafting, and refinement).

This approach reduces generic, templated outreach and produces emails tailored to the recipient's context, improving relevance and response rates.

---
## RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Before the writer agent drafts anything, the system retrieves verified context about the recipient company (industry, services, trust score, market evaluation) from `rag/company_data.json`, using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. This grounds every email in real data rather than LLM-invented facts. A minimum relevance threshold (0.15) prevents a weak, coincidental text match from being treated as valid company context.

## Multi-Agent Orchestration (CrewAI)

Each LLM call — drafting, revising, or reviewing — runs as a single-agent, single-task CrewAI `Crew`, routed to Groq's Llama 3.3 70B model via CrewAI's `LLM` class. The writer (temperature 0.7) and reviewer (temperature 0.2) are deliberately tuned differently: fluent generation vs. consistent judgment. The orchestrator loops between them, feeding the reviewer's structured feedback back into the writer's next revision, up to 3 rounds.


## Features

- ✉️ **Personalized Email Generation** — Generates cold emails tailored to specific companies, roles, or prospects.
- 📚 **Document Retrieval (RAG)** — Retrieves relevant context from a knowledge base (e.g., portfolio, past projects, case studies) to ground generated content.
- 🔍 **Vector Search using TF IDF retrival and cosine similarity** — Efficient semantic search over embedded documents.And find the best matching company for the required problem
- 🤖 **Multi-Agent Workflow** — Coordinates multiple agents (e.g., research agent, retrieval agent, writer agent) to collaboratively produce the final email.
- ⚡ **FastAPI Backend** — Exposes the generation pipeline via a lightweight REST API.

Each agent operates independently but shares state through the orchestration layer, allowing modular updates (e.g., swapping the retrieval strategy or LLM provider) without affecting the rest of the pipeline.

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shubhangigiri2006-hub/cold_email_generator.git
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

---

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)).
2. Verify API keys for your chosen LLM provider are valid and have sufficient quota.

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# LLM Provider API Key
GROQ_LLM_API KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
TAVILIY_API_KEY=tavily_api_key

#
username=admin
password=changme

#SMTP 
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=" "
SMTP_PASSWORD=" "
```

> Replace the values with your own credentials and configuration. Never commit your `.env` file to version control.

---

## How to Run the Project

1. **Start the FastAPI server**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2.Pip install streamlit
Streamlit run app.py
---

## Example Workflow

**Input:**
```json
{
  "company_name": "Acme Corp",
  "job_description": "Looking for a backend engineer skilled in Python and distributed systems.",
  "sender_profile": "Experienced backend developer with 3+ years in Python and microservices."
}
```

**Pipeline:**
1. The **Research Agent** extracts key details from the job description.
2. The **Retrieval Agent** queries ChromaDB for relevant portfolio projects or case studies.
3. The **Writer Agent** drafts a personalized email combining the retrieved context.
4. The **Reviewer Agent** polishes tone and formatting.

**Output:**
```
Subject: Backend Engineer Ready to Support Acme Corp's Distributed Systems Goals

Hi [Hiring Manager],

I came across Acme Corp's opening for a backend engineer skilled in Python and 
distributed systems, and I believe my experience building scalable microservices 
aligns well with your team's needs...

## Evaluation



If evaluation is implemented, consider documenting:
- **Relevance scoring** — How closely generated emails match retrieved context.
- **Human feedback loop** — Manual review/rating of generated emails.
- **A/B testing** — Comparing response rates across different prompt strategies.

---

## Future Improvements

- 🔄 Add feedback loop for continuous learning from sent email performance
- 🌐 Support multiple LLM providers with runtime switching
- 📊 Add analytics dashboard for tracking email performance
- 🧵 Add conversation memory for multi-touch email sequences
- 🖥️ Build a frontend UI for non-technical users

---

## Known Issues / Limitations

- **Web-based email discovery is unreliable.** Search results sometimes surface listicle/aggregator articles ("Top 10 Best...") rather than individual companies, and even real company sites often hide contact emails behind forms or JavaScript rendering that simple scraping can't see. The manual-entry fallback exists specifically because of this.
- **CrewAI + Groq required two workarounds:** (1) a version conflict between CrewAI's and LiteLLM's required `httpx` versions, resolved via controlled reinstallation order; (2) a confirmed CrewAI bug ([issue #5886](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/5886)) where a prompt-caching field is injected into messages for all providers but only stripped for Anthropic, causing Groq to reject requests — resolved via a documented community monkey-patch.
- **Admin authentication is a placeholder** — plaintext credential comparison against environment variables, not production-grade auth.
- **Single-tenant by design** — configured for one organization profile at a time via `.env`.
- **RAG uses TF-IDF, not semantic embeddings** — matches on keyword overlap rather than meaning; a natural upgrade path is `sentence-transformers` + FAISS/Chroma as the knowledge base scales.
